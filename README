LENNON MOSAIC APPLICATION STORIES
=================================

User/Role Contexts:

	SysAdmin - System admin works with the Mosaic from the command line
	Admin - Admin works with the mosaic from the application interface
	System - Behind the Scenes processing
	User - 3rd party visitor who views and interacts with the Mosaic

Model/Action Contexts:

	Mosaic - The main class, responsible for creating and managing the Mosaic itself
	Master - The Master Photo that the Mosaic is built on
	Content Source - Class representing a source of image content, this class is responsible for pulling the new content
	Content - Class representing a Content Item, responsible for processing and storage of a single image

Other:
	The Application - the website interface for both viewing and managing the Mosaic	


------------------------------
Iteration Descriptions
------------------------------

Step One: will mostly be run by me at the command line to get the project off the ground, make sure the actual image manipulation parts are working and compiling the mosaic properly and the outputted image is what we want it to be.  This section will be tested using a single image feed from photobucket.

Step Two: will be to add genuine feedback to the script so that we can see what is happening as we go along.  This process takes a considerable amount of time, so good user communication will be key.

Step Three: will then be to add the ability to record and save the information on the images, save the master image, and generate the new mosaic from the existing data.  This step is expected to speed up the image creation process.

Step Four: will be adding multiple Image feed sources to the Mosaic engine.  At this point we will add the Creative Allies feed and the YouTube feed.

Step Five: will be to enhance the presentation of the mosaic into both a standard output image and a javascript driven interactive table which will (hopefully) look feel and work like the YouTube flash based one.

Step Six: will be to move all of this into the Creative Allies application and create the ability for any admin (You, Josh, etc.) to manage the image sources and images used to create the mosaic.

Feature: SysAdmin Gets Average Color

The SysAdmin calculates the average color of each Image Tile
And assigns it to an array with the average as the key and the image as the value.

Scenario: Creating the Image Object
	Given I have a Mosaic Instance
	And an Array of Tile URLS
	When the average_color is called
	Then the system should create a MosaicImage Object
	And call it an image
	
Scenario: average_color gets the average color of an image
	Given I have a Mosaic Instance
	And an Image Object
	When the average_color is called
	Then the system should create an Image Object
	And should average the greens of the image
	And should average the reds of the image
	And should average the blues of the image
	And should assign the average values to the Array as a Hash
